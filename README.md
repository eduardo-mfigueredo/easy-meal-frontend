    <h1>Easy Meal</h1>

    This is project for my personal portfolio. 
    
    It's an application that helps owners of weekly meal 
    delivery businesses manage their menu options and orders.

    You can test it out at: https://easy-meal-65a53.web.app/
    
    To check out the Admin Area of the app, click in 'Login' on the 
    top right corner of the page and use the following credentials:

    test@easy-meal.com
    123456

    You'll be able to check menu options that have been created. 
    You can also create new ones.

    Also, feel free to clone the repo and run it locally, if you want.

    To run it locally, you'll need to have Node.js and Angular CLI installed.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:eduardo-mfigueredo/easy-meal-frontend.git
    ```


    Please, note that there is no implementation for the checkout yet,
    in case that you simulate an order. Any suggestion on how to implement
    a mock for a order processing is welcome.

    Feedback is also welcome, as well as contributions.

    Thanks for checking it out!
